# googleCloudTextToSpeech

This small project aims to convert a txt file into a voice file, using Googles text to speech API.
The code avoids the max char limit by spliting the input.

In order to use the API you have to register an account at Google Cloud.
The txt should be in the same folder and named input.txt.
